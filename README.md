A Python-based research repository for quantitative trading, algorithmic
strategies, and backtesting. Not financial advice. If this repo blows up your
account, that's on you :skull:.

[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) is the package manager. It's pretty awesome.

Note that I use [vectorbtpro](https://vectorbt.pro/) for backtesting, which
requires a subscription. It's also pretty awesome.
